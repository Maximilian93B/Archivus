### **File Processing Job Types**
```go
// Non-AI job types for Phase 2
const (
    JobTypeThumbnailGeneration = "thumbnail_generation"
    JobTypeFileValidation     = "file_validation"  
    JobTypeMetadataExtraction = "metadata_extraction"
    JobTypePreviewGeneration  = "preview_generation"
)
```

### **Docker Service Extension**
```yaml
# Add to docker-compose.yml
worker:
  build: .
  command: ["./archivus-worker"]
  environment:
    - WORKER_TYPE=file_processor
    - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
  depends_on:
    - redis
